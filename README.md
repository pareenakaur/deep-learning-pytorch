# Deep Learning Project using Pytorch 
<ul>
  <li><strong>Image Segmentation</strong>:
  <p>In this project, I have written a custom dataset class for an image-mask dataset. I have applied segmentation augmentation to augment images and their masks. I have used the albumentation library for the image mask augmentation. I have also plotted the image-mask pairs. In this process, I have loaded a pre-trained convolutional neural network such as U-Net for the segmentation problem using a segmentation model pytorch library. I have created a train and evaluator function to write the training loop and in turn train the model.</p>
